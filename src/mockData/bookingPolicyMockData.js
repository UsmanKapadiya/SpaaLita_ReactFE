                </h5>
                <h5>Due to the majority of our service providers being in high demand and booking
                    far
                    in advance, we require 24-hour notice to change or cancel your appointment. It can
                    be
                    very difficult to fill a spot with minimal notice.
                </h5>

                    but please try your best to give us ample notice so we can fill your spot.</h5>
                <h5 class="pt-2">Failure to give 24 hours notice will result in a 50% fee of service.</h5>
                <h5 class="pt-2">No show will be charged full amount of service.</h5>
                <h5 class="pt-2">WEDDING/EVENT GROUP POLICY:
                </h5>
                <h5>A 50% deposit is required to book large groups. Should the date need to be changed
                    we require a week notice. This will give us time to fill up the spots. Same cancellation
                    policies apply to this. </h5>
